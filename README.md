# Book-Genie - Book recommendation AI tool

## Inspiration
I was at the bookstore looking for book recommendations online when I thought of using the newly learned skills from workshops a hackathon project

## What it does
It recommends the reader with the top 5 books related to their interests that other readers have in common (just like how Instagram & Facebook recommendation system works) and helps them get the book from the wide range of choices.

## How we built it
Built it using different tech and tools like: Kaggle Notebook, numpy, pandas, gensim, sklearn, cosine_similarity

## Challenges we ran into
Had to debug a lot of things during the entire coding. Had to clean data a lot for efficiency and ran into numerous error as python was not my coding strength

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Proud of using all the newly learned skills from workshops in this project, SUCCESSFULLY!

## What we learned
A lot of new skills and improved coding & debugging abilities

## What's next for Book Genie
Stay tuned! 
~This is going to be upgraded with Hybrid based filtering method (current version uses Collaborative based). Moreover, a new frontend GUI will be provided.
